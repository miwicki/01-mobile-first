## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

Setting up a mobile and responsive web designed site from the starter code provided by the client.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Copy the starter code folder to have a base to work from and include the client's images.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This site consist of one HTMl file and five CSS files so far. I used ico-moon fonts provided by client for all styling. I implemented the 3 images provided by the client to help mirror their concept site. Languages utilized were HTML5, CSS3. Additional Google fonts were added to the CSS files for further styling.
